<meta property="og:description" content="All the Way by Robert Schenkkan was commissioned and produced by the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF), Ashland, Oregon. This play covers the first year in the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson. It begins in late November 1963, when Vice President Johnson assumes the role of president in the days following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; and it ends in November 1964, when Johnson is elected president by the people.
The present essay identifies and, where possible, provides access to a number of historical sources that might enrich the reader’s understanding of the play and of the Johnson presidency itself. An annotated production script for All the Way (held by Columbia University’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library) identifies some of the historical sources taken into consideration by the play’s author and also provides comments regarding various situations depicted in the play.  That production script is quoted from below as needed and it was substantially helpful in identifying some of the key historical sources that are given prominence in the present essay.

The Drama of Johnson’s First Year as President
Throughout the play a tally board advises the audience of the number of days remaining until the presidential election of November 3, 1964. This is an overarching indicator of one of the play’s main sources of dramatic tension: Will Johnson, in fact, be elected president when it comes time for the American people to vote? One of the notes in the play’s annotated production script advises us that Johnson’s “greatest ambition was to become president and from the moment he had assumed office, he was worried about the 1964 election” (87n). The tally board is a dramatic device that keeps the audience aware of that ambition and those worries.
Schenkkan has chosen to focus his drama on challenges that tested Johnson’s leadership skills: for example, his efforts to gather congressional support for the bill that would be passed into public law as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and to maintain unity in a Democratic Party that was deeply divided between progressive impulses and reactionary tendencies. All of these challenges are met under the shadow of the tally board, reminding us that Johnson’s chance to serve a full term as president is, to some degree, at stake in how he confronts each new crisis. 

One Simple Starting Point: The Public Speeches of President Lyndon Baines Johnson 
Early in Act I, Scene 1 of All the Way, Schenkkan provides a condensed adaptation of the “Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress” that Johnson delivered on November 27, 1963. The full text of that address is well worth reading, because in it Johnson describes his sense of the legacy of the late President John F. Kennedy, and also urges Congress “to enact a civil rights law.” An audio link in the right margin of the page linked above allows you to listen to Johnson delivering that address. 
The American Presidency Project (UC Santa Barbara), which provides the text and audio file linked above, is an excellent resource for exploring and accessing Johnson’s public communications.

The Life and Political Career of Lyndon Baines Johnson (1908-1973)
The LBJ Presidential Library provides a wide range of information about Johnson’s life and his political career. You might wish to consider their Biography and Life and Times pages. Another useful starting point for considering Johnson’s life and career is the entry for “Johnson, Lyndon Baines” in American National Biography (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999) or in its online counterpart American National Biography Online.  (CUL Access)
For an excellent single-volume account, readers should see Robert Dallek’s Lyndon B. Johnson: Portrait of a President (New York : Oxford University Press, 2004). This book is, in fact, Dallek’s own abridgement of his earlier two-volume biography:  Lone Star Rising: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1908-1960 (1991); and Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973 (1998), both from Oxford University Press. Readers seeking additional detail about the period of November 1963 - November 1964 should go back to the second volume of Dallek’s original full biography.
Robert Caro has now published four out of a projected five volumes in his biographical series The Years of Lyndon Johnson. His fourth volume, The Passage of Power (New York : Alfred A. Knopf, 2012), covers the period from 1960 through March of 1964. Both Caro and Dallek are model biographers, providing intensive and in-depth coverage and analysis and drawing upon a wide range of sources: interviews personally conducted with persons who knew and worked with Johnson, archives held at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and elsewhere, as well as an extensive range of available published sources.
 
Johnson Speaking off (on?) the Record: The Presidential Recordings
In 1973, not long after the death of Lyndon Johnson, a member of Johnson&#039;s staff gave to the LBJ Library &quot;850 hours of audio recordings from the Johnson presidency, 643 hours of which comprised recordings of Johnson’s telephone conversations.&quot; That these tapes would ultimately be made available through the library to researchers &quot;was President Johnson&#039;s wish.&quot; They were &quot;released to the public beginning in 1993.&quot; See: The Presidential Recordings: Lyndon B. Johnson; select “Proceed”; select “Front Matter”; then select “Preface”, by David Shreve.
Shreve, continues on in his “Preface” to reflect as follows: &quot;As historians would discover with the first large-scale releases of the Johnson recordings in the 1990s, here was President Johnson, voice loud and distinct, brandishing the telephone, his preferred instrument of both administration and persuasion. Unlike the other presidential recordings in existence, most notably those from the presidencies of John Kennedy and Richard Nixon, most of President Johnson’s capture phone calls rather than meetings.&quot;
 Comprehensive transcriptions of these tapes, covering dates November 22, 1963 through July 4, 1964, have been published in a series titled The Presidential Recordings (New York: Norton, 2005- ). Even those who do not wish to consult the recordings or transcripts in detail, should take a look at the “Front Matter” from The Presidential Recordings series. This “Front Matter,” from which I have quoted above, is made freely available by The Miller Center (University of Virginia). In these various prefaces and introductions one finds discussions of the history of these recordings as well as useful reflections on the impact that they have had on Johnson scholarship.
 The Johnson tapes are extensively cited in two of the main books referred to in the production script of Schenkkan’s All the Way: Kotz’s Judgment Days and Branch’s Pillar of Fire. Moreover, Schenkkan is clearly writing from within an historiographic world in which our vision of Johnson’s leadership has been transformed by the detailed recorded evidence of just how he exerted influence and worked towards his goals in conversations held behind the scenes.
 
Martin Luther King, Jr.
 Of all of the major figures whose interactions with Lyndon Johnson are depicted in All the Way, Martin Luther King, Jr. is the one who differs most sharply from Johnson in terms of outlook, experience, and political methods. The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute (Stanford University) is a good place to begin consideration of King’s life and influence. It includes the King Online Encyclopedia as well as a useful biographical essay.
 The most comprehensively detailed history of King’s life and times is a series of three-volumes by Taylor Branch: Parting the Waters: America in the King years, 1954-63 (1988); Pillar of Fire: America in the King years, 1963-65 (1998); At Canaan&#039;s Edge: America in the King years, 1965-68 (2006). In his Preface to Pillar of Fire, Branch writes “Strictly speaking this book is not a biography of Martin Luther King, Jr., though he is at its heart. . . . My purpose is to write a narrative history of the civil rights movement” (p. xiv).
 Of the three volumes in Branch’s America in the King years series, Pillar of Fire is the one most closely relevant to Schenkkan’s All the Way; and it is frequently cited in the play’s script notes. Pillar of Fire has won praise from critics for its multidimensional portrayal of the civil rights movement: capturing both the impact of persons in leadership roles such as King as well as the impetus arising from grassroots activism. See, for example, Social Policy; Summer98, Vol. 28 Issue 4, p 36-42.
 
The Civil Rights Act of 1964
Act 1 of All the Way ends with President Johnson signing into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This action took place on July 2, 1964 and it concludes one major arc of the action of the play.
For a concise account of Johnson’s involvement in the passage of this law along with a link to the text of the law itself, see Gittinger, Ted and Allen Fisher. &quot;LBJ Champions the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&quot; Prologue Magazine 36 (2) Summer 2004. For more extensive discussion of the history of this Act and the Bill that preceded it, you may wish to consult Nick Kotz’s book Judgment days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws That Changed America. It is particularly detailed in representing Johnson’s interactions with King and with Congress. It also includes within its scope an account of some of the other key pieces of civil rights legislation passed during Johnson’s administration.
 For a substantially helpful article emphasizing the context and impact of the law, see “Civil Rights Act of 1964” in Major Acts of Congress Ed. Brian K. Landsberg. 3 vols. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2004, 1, 109-115. (CUL Access)
 
The Democratic Convention of 1964 and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  
The Democratic Convention, held in Atlantic City in August 1964, provided further evidence of the issues of race, segregation, and unequal treatment that the recently signed Civil Rights Act of 1964 had begun to address. One major sign of unresolved tensions within the Democratic Party itself was the fact that two distinct Mississippi delegations arrived at the convention, each with the aim of representing that state.  
 &quot;In early 1964, as part of Freedom Summer, Mississippi civil rights activists afﬁliated with the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) in Mississippi launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). Claiming status as ‘‘the only democratically constituted body of Mississippi citizens,’’ they appealed to the credentials committee of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) of 1964 to recognize their party’s delegation in place of the all-white Democratic Party delegation from Mississippi (Victoria Gray, July 1964).&quot; from Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) in King Online Encyclopedia
The play depicts Johnson’s anxieties that all of the Southern delegations might walk out of the convention if the all-white Mississippi delegation were replaced by the delegation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. It also shows Johnson engaging in a variety of tactics to prevent such a replacement: for example, delegating Hubert Humphrey to make various compromise proposals to the MFDP; and authorizing J. Edgar Hoover to conduct illegal surveillance of MDFP members. For a detailed discussion of the MFDP and the Democratic Convention, see Branch Pillar of Fire, p. 448-489.
For digital facsimiles of a wide range of documents produced by the MFDP, do a search for Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in the Civil Rights in Mississippi Digital Archive (University of Southern Mississippi Libraries)
The Democratic Party Platform of 1964 from August 24, 1964 is a key document for understanding how the Democratic Party chose to present itself with the upcoming presidential election in view.
 
The Presidential Election of 1964 and the Legacy of President Johnson
Johnson’s victory in the 1964 presidential election was, in fact, substantial. See Election of 1964 (The American Presidency Project) for a breakdown of votes by state. 
Johnson’s legacy, like the legacy of any president or significant public figure, is the subject of ongoing discussion. The parameters of the discussion change due to various factors. New information becomes available--as, for example, when the Johnson tape recordings began being publicly released in 1993. Our own perspective changes also, as issues with which past presidents have dealt resurface in our society.
The New York Times obituary for Lyndon Johnson, published January 23, 1973, already points to some of the key issues. Under the heading “A Legacy of Progress,” we find: &quot;Although his vision of a Great Society dissolved in the morass of war in Vietnam, Mr. Johnson left to the nation a legacy of progress and innovation in civil rights, Social Security, education, housing and other programs attesting to his fundamental affection for his fellow Americans.&quot;  Robert Schenkkan’s All the Way uses the resources of the dramatist to make us freshly aware of Johnson’s “legacy of progress and innovation in civil rights” as it can be understood through reconsidering a particularly challenging period in his presidency.

This play covers the first year in the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson. It begins in late November 1963, when Vice President Johnson assumes the role of president in the days following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; and it ends in November 1964, when Johnson is elected president by the people.</p>
<p>The present essay identifies and, where possible, provides access to a number of historical sources that might enrich the reader’s understanding of the play and of the Johnson presidency itself. An annotated production script for <i>All the Way</i> (held by Columbia University’s <a href="http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml.html" target="_blank">Rare Book and Manuscript Library</a>) identifies some of the historical sources taken into consideration by the play’s author and also provides comments regarding various situations depicted in the play.  That production script is quoted from below as needed and it was substantially helpful in identifying some of the key historical sources that are given prominence in the present essay.</p>
</p>
<p><strong>The Drama of Johnson’s First Year as President</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the play a tally board advises the audience of the number of days remaining until the presidential election of November 3, 1964. This is an overarching indicator of one of the play’s main sources of dramatic tension: Will Johnson, in fact, be elected president when it comes time for the American people to vote? One of the notes in the play’s annotated production script advises us that Johnson’s “greatest ambition was to become president and from the moment he had assumed office, he was worried about the 1964 election” (87n). The tally board is a dramatic device that keeps the audience aware of that ambition and those worries.</p>
<p>Schenkkan has chosen to focus his drama on challenges that tested Johnson’s leadership skills: for example, his efforts to gather congressional support for the bill that would be passed into public law as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and to maintain unity in a Democratic Party that was deeply divided between progressive impulses and reactionary tendencies. All of these challenges are met under the shadow of the tally board, reminding us that Johnson’s chance to serve a full term as president is, to some degree, at stake in how he confronts each new crisis. </p>
</p>
<p><strong>One Simple Starting Point: The Public Speeches of President Lyndon Baines Johnson</strong> </p>
<p>Early in Act I, Scene 1 of <i>All the Way</i>, Schenkkan provides a condensed adaptation of the <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25988&amp;st=&amp;st1=" target="_blank">“Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress”</a> that Johnson delivered on November 27, 1963. The full text of that address is well worth reading, because in it Johnson describes his sense of the legacy of the late President John F. Kennedy, and also urges Congress “to enact a civil rights law.” An audio link in the right margin of the page linked above allows you to listen to Johnson delivering that address. </p>
<p>The American Presidency Project (UC Santa Barbara), which provides the text and audio file linked above, is an excellent resource for exploring and accessing Johnson’s public communications.</p>

<p><strong>The Life and Political Career of Lyndon Baines Johnson (1908-1973)</strong></p>
<p>The LBJ Presidential Library provides a wide range of information about Johnson’s life and his political career. You might wish to consider their <a href="http://www.lbjlibrary.org/lyndon-baines-johnson/lbj-biography" target="_blank">Biography</a> and <a href="http://www.lbjlibrary.org/lyndon-baines-johnson/timeline" target="_blank">Life and Times</a> pages. Another useful starting point for considering Johnson’s life and career is the entry for “Johnson, Lyndon Baines” in <i>American National Biography </i>(New York: Oxford University Press, 1999)<i> </i>or in its online counterpart <i>American National Biography Online</i>.  <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?AH-D79826TJE3316" target="_blank">(CUL Access)</a></p>
<p>For an excellent single-volume account, readers should see Robert Dallek’s <i>Lyndon B. Johnson: Portrait of a President</i> (New York : Oxford University Press, 2004). This book is, in fact, Dallek’s own abridgement of his earlier two-volume biography:  <i>Lone Star Rising: Lyndon </i><i>Johnson</i><i> and His Times, 1908-1960</i> (1991); and <i>Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1961-1973</i> (1998), both from Oxford University Press. Readers seeking additional detail about the period of November 1963 - November 1964 should go back to the second volume of Dallek’s original full biography.</p>
<p>Robert Caro has now published four out of a projected five volumes in his biographical series <i>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</i>. His fourth volume, <i>The Passage of Power</i> (New York : Alfred A. Knopf, 2012), covers the period from 1960 through March of 1964. Both Caro and Dallek are model biographers, providing intensive and in-depth coverage and analysis and drawing upon a wide range of sources: interviews personally conducted with persons who knew and worked with Johnson, archives held at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and elsewhere, as well as an extensive range of available published sources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Johnson Speaking off (on?) the Record: <i>The Presidential Recordings</i></strong></p>
<p>In 1973, not long after the death of Lyndon Johnson, a member of Johnson's staff gave to the LBJ Library "850 hours of audio recordings from the Johnson presidency, 643 hours of which comprised recordings of Johnson’s telephone conversations." That these tapes would ultimately be made available through the library to researchers "was President Johnson's wish." They were "released to the public beginning in 1993." See: <a href="http://whitehousetapes.net/content/lbjdvd/" target="_blank">The Presidential Recordings: Lyndon B. Johnson</a>; select “Proceed”; select “Front Matter”; then select “Preface”, by David Shreve.</p>
<p>Shreve, continues on in his “Preface” to reflect as follows: "As historians would discover with the first large-scale releases of the Johnson recordings in the 1990s, here was President Johnson, voice loud and distinct, brandishing the telephone, his preferred instrument of both administration and persuasion. Unlike the other presidential recordings in existence, most notably those from the presidencies of John Kennedy and Richard Nixon, most of President Johnson’s capture phone calls rather than meetings."</p>
<p> Comprehensive transcriptions of these tapes, covering dates November 22, 1963 through July 4, 1964, have been published in a series titled <i>The Presidential Recordings</i> (New York: Norton, 2005- ). Even those who do not wish to consult the recordings or transcripts in detail, should take a look at the “Front Matter” from <i>The Presidential Recordings</i> series. This “Front Matter,” from which I have quoted above, is made freely available by <a href="http://millercenter.org/" target="_blank">The Miller Center</a> (University of Virginia). In these various prefaces and introductions one finds discussions of the history of these recordings as well as useful reflections on the impact that they have had on Johnson scholarship.</p>
<p> The Johnson tapes are extensively cited in two of the main books referred to in the production script of Schenkkan’s <i>All the Way</i>: Kotz’s <i>Judgment Days</i> and Branch’s <i>Pillar of Fire</i>. Moreover, Schenkkan is clearly writing from within an historiographic world in which our vision of Johnson’s leadership has been transformed by the detailed recorded evidence of just how he exerted influence and worked towards his goals in conversations held behind the scenes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Martin Luther King, Jr.</strong></p>
<p> Of all of the major figures whose interactions with Lyndon Johnson are depicted in <i>All the Way</i>, Martin Luther King, Jr. is the one who differs most sharply from Johnson in terms of outlook, experience, and political methods. The <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute</a> (Stanford University) is a good place to begin consideration of King’s life and influence. It includes the <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia_contents" target="_blank">King Online Encyclopedia</a> as well as a useful <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_martin_luther_king_jr_biography/" target="_blank">biographical essay</a>.</p>
<p> The most comprehensively detailed history of King’s life and times is a series of three-volumes by Taylor Branch: <i>Parting the Waters: America in the King years, 1954-63</i> (1988); <i>Pillar of Fire: America in the King years, 1963-65</i> (1998); <i>At Canaan's Edge: America in the King years, 1965-68</i> (2006). In his Preface to <i>Pillar of Fire</i>, Branch writes “Strictly speaking this book is not a biography of Martin Luther King, Jr., though he is at its heart. . . . My purpose is to write a narrative history of the civil rights movement” (p. xiv).</p>
<p> Of the three volumes in Branch’s <i>America in the King years </i>series, <i>Pillar of Fire</i> is the one most closely relevant to Schenkkan’s <i>All the Way</i>; and it is frequently cited in the play’s script notes. <i>Pillar of Fire</i> has won praise from critics for its multidimensional portrayal of the civil rights movement: capturing both the impact of persons in leadership roles such as King as well as the impetus arising from grassroots activism. See, for example, <a href="http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=d97377a6-cd15-43d2-a167-7e0edacd80ca%40sessionmgr12&amp;vid=11&amp;hid=25&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=ssf&amp;AN=511070385" target="_blank">Social Policy; Summer98, Vol. 28 Issue 4, p 36-42</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Civil Rights Act of 1964</strong></p>
<p>Act 1 of <i>All the Way</i> ends with President Johnson signing into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This action took place on July 2, 1964 and it concludes one major arc of the action of the play.</p>
<p>For a concise account of Johnson’s involvement in the passage of this law along with a link to the text of the law itself, see <a href="http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/summer/civil-rights-act-1.html" target="_blank">Gittinger, Ted and Allen Fisher. "LBJ Champions the Civil Rights Act of 1964." <i>Prologue Magazine</i> 36 (2) Summer 2004</a>. For more extensive discussion of the history of this Act and the Bill that preceded it, you may wish to consult Nick Kotz’s book <i>Judgment days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws That Changed America</i>. It is particularly detailed in representing Johnson’s interactions with King and with Congress. It also includes within its scope an account of some of the other key pieces of civil rights legislation passed during Johnson’s administration.</p>
<p> For a substantially helpful article emphasizing the context and impact of the law, see “Civil Rights Act of 1964” in <i>Major Acts of Congress</i> Ed. Brian K. Landsberg. 3 vols. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2004, 1, 109-115. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?AH-D79826TJE3655" target="_blank">(CUL Access)</a></p>

<p><strong>The Democratic Convention of 1964 and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party  </strong></p>
<p>The Democratic Convention, held in Atlantic City in August 1964, provided further evidence of the issues of race, segregation, and unequal treatment that the recently signed Civil Rights Act of 1964 had begun to address. One major sign of unresolved tensions within the Democratic Party itself was the fact that two distinct Mississippi delegations arrived at the convention, each with the aim of representing that state.  </p>
<p> "In early 1964, as part of Freedom Summer, Mississippi civil rights activists afﬁliated with the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) in Mississippi launched the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). Claiming status as ‘‘the only democratically constituted body of Mississippi citizens,’’ they appealed to the credentials committee of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) of 1964 to recognize their party’s delegation in place of the all-white Democratic Party delegation from Mississippi (Victoria Gray, July 1964)." from <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_mississippi_freedom_democratic_party/" target="_blank">Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP)</a> in <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/encyclopedia_contents" target="_blank">King Online Encyclopedia</a></p>
<p>The play depicts Johnson’s anxieties that all of the Southern delegations might walk out of the convention if the all-white Mississippi delegation were replaced by the delegation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. It also shows Johnson engaging in a variety of tactics to prevent such a replacement: for example, delegating Hubert Humphrey to make various compromise proposals to the MFDP; and authorizing J. Edgar Hoover to conduct illegal surveillance of MDFP members. For a detailed discussion of the MFDP and the Democratic Convention, see Branch <i>Pillar of Fire</i>, p. 448-489.</p>
<p>For digital facsimiles of a wide range of documents produced by the MFDP, do a search for Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in the <a href="http://digilib.usm.edu/crmda.php" target="_blank">Civil Rights in Mississippi Digital Archive</a> (University of Southern Mississippi Libraries)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29603" target="_blank">Democratic Party Platform of 1964</a> from August 24, 1964 is a key document for understanding how the Democratic Party chose to present itself with the upcoming presidential election in view.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Presidential Election of 1964 and the Legacy of President Johnson</strong></p>
<p>Johnson’s victory in the 1964 presidential election was, in fact, substantial. See <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showelection.php?year=1964" target="_blank">Election of 1964</a> (The American Presidency Project) for a breakdown of votes by state. </p>
<p>Johnson’s legacy, like the legacy of any president or significant public figure, is the subject of ongoing discussion. The parameters of the discussion change due to various factors. New information becomes available--as, for example, when the Johnson tape recordings began being publicly released in 1993. Our own perspective changes also, as issues with which past presidents have dealt resurface in our society.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0827.html" target="_blank">The New York Times obituary for Lyndon Johnson</a><span>, published January 23, 1973, already points to some of the key issues. Under the heading “A Legacy of Progress,” we find: "Although his vision of a Great Society dissolved in the morass of war in Vietnam, Mr. Johnson left to the nation a legacy of progress and innovation in civil rights, Social Security, education, housing and other programs attesting to his fundamental affection for his fellow Americans."  Robert Schenkkan’s </span><i>All the Way</i><span> uses the resources of the dramatist to make us freshly aware of Johnson’s “legacy of progress and innovation in civil rights” as it can be understood through reconsidering a particularly challenging period in his presidency.</span></p>

 			About the Edward M. Kennedy Prize
 			</h4>
 			<p>The Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History honors the late Senator’s love of theater and his profound interest in American history. It is awarded annually through Columbia University to a new play or musical that enlists theater’s power to explore the past of the United States, to participate meaningfully in the great issues of our day through public conversation, grounded in historical understanding, that is essential to the functioning of a democracy. </p>
