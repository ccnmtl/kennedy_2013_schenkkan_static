 <title>Interview with the Director</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-teaser field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;with Bill Rauch, Director of Oregon Shakespeare Festival&#039;s production of &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What inspired the American Revolutions Cycle, and what are you hoping it accomplishes?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The initial inspiration was the 10 plays that formed Shakespeare’s history cycle. Shakespeare wrote about transferences of power in his own country’s history at a time of great anxiety for his fellow citizens (who would replace childless Elizabeth?).  We wanted to address our own age’s anxieties and hopes by dramatizing moments of great change in our country’s past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We wanted to create new work—new American plays—that were on a thematic scale and had the ambition of Shakespeare’s work.  And we felt confident that we had the acting company and the production artisans, including our wildly gifted costume shop, to pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you typically drawn to historical theater, and if so why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It’s interesting: when it comes to classical texts, I’m more attracted to productions that directly connect to the here and now.  With new work I am often attracted to stories that transport us to another time and place.  I learned so much about LBJ’s era from working on &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt;.  We’re currently doing a new play at OSF set in 17th Century Mexico, which has exposed me to the caste system based on racial and ethnic identity and completely shifted how I look at racism on the West Coast of the United States today.  The short answer to the question is: yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did the American Revolutions Project lead you to commissioning Robert Schenkkan&#039;s All the Way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Alison Carey, my brilliant colleague who runs American Revolutions: the United States History Cycle, and I began to think of playwrights to invite to join the inaugural class of AR, Robert was at the top of our list.  It was Robert’s work that first brought me to the Oregon Shakespeare festival when I directed his &lt;i&gt;Handler&lt;/i&gt; in 2002.  I also worked on the world premier of &lt;i&gt;By the Waters of Babylon&lt;/i&gt; in Ashland in 2005.  Robert’s canvases are often epic, always political, and he is deeply concerned with the largest questions about how the United States aspires and often fails to live up to our nation’s promise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Given the success of our working relationship and his thematic concerns as a writer, he was an ideal choice for this program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is it like to work with a cast as large as that of All the Way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was drawn to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival as a freelance artist, and eventually as the company’s artistic leader, in part because of the resident acting company.  OSF doesn’t only have the largest acting company in the country; it is also one of the only resident acting companies that remain.  I believe we, as a field, have dismantled our resident companies to the great detriment of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The great plays that are constantly produced throughout the world over the centuries were written with and for a resident company, usually working in rotating repertory.  The 17-actor cast of &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt; is par for the course for OSF’s robust and gifted company.  And the company is one reason I am proud to call OSF my artistic home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What kind of research did you do to prepare for directing All the Way?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our dramaturg, Tom Bryant, was an endless source of facts and context about what was really happening.  Robert is incredibly clear about where and why he has made character conflations and time compressions for dramatic purposes so Tom and Robert were my most important sources.  With that said, of course I watched a lot of video and read as much as I could to be prepared for this massive undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Costume designer Deb Dryden and projections designer Shawn Sagady also brought a tremendous amount of research to respond to.  I can never overemphasize the importance of designers as a dramaturgical influence and as true co-authors of the productions that I direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How would you describe the roles you and Schenkkan played in the production of ATW, as director and playwright? What did that dynamic look like?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very lucky to work with a playwright like Robert Schenkkan because he is a total theater artist; his theatrical instincts are impeccable and I trust him completely.  He was able to be with us in the rehearsal room for most of the process and we have a very open and collaborative relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I respect his final word on every comma in the script and he respects my directorial instincts.  Neither of us, however, makes a major decision about the play or production without a conversation without the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did you go about determining set and stage directions? How much did you draw from written directions in the script? Did you have a vision for all of these, or did you rely on the scenic/set designer for this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witnessing, having the cast sit onstage for much of the dramatic action and watch their fellow players in the center, was Robert’s idea.  Our brilliant set designer Chris Acebo and I brought the idea of both internal and eternal civic architecture to create the environment.  As with all aspects of this production the scenic approach for &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt; was a very felicitous blend of instincts of the playwright, director and designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What led you to becoming a director? Where did you start, and how did you get here?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be an actor as a child.  And I acted in as many plays as I could from elementary school to my first semester at college.  In my second semester, I directed my first full-length play and it hit me with incredible clarity that I had found my life’s work.  With many of my dearest college friends I co-founded a community-based theater that traveled the country.  We worked with residents of both rural and urban communities, often first-time actors, to create adaptations of classic plays as well as new works.  Cornerstone Theater Company continues to thrive in Los Angeles, 28 years after its founding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cornerstone was invited to create community collaborative projects with some of our country’s largest regional theaters and those projects, in turn, led me to direct in some of those theaters on my own as a freelance artist.  When I first directed at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, I sensed that I had found a new artistic home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&#039;s on your plate next? What is exciting to you right now, about your projects or in the theater world in general?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m extremely excited to be directing the sequel to &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt;, Robert’s &lt;i&gt;Great Society&lt;/i&gt; in Ashland, opening in July 2014.  Many of the cast members of the original production will be reprising their roles and our audiences seem to be as giddy with anticipation as I am.  I hope to be lucky enough to work with Dan O’Brien again in the future as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m one of the lucky ones.  I get to live my dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
