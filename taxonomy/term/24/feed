&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at Lyndon Johnson’s presidency in that light one can certainly see that Lyndon Johnson certainly embodies the expedient pursuit of power. Statements of his stand out as textbook lessons of the practical application of power: Public statement of positions, Johnson felt, were stumbling blocks to effective legislative action. He felt they tended to freeze men into positions making it more difficult to later accept compromise. “The process itself” Johnson said “requires a certain amount of deception. If the full implications of a bill were known before its enactment, it would never get passed.” On the criticism by more moralistic Senators of his behind the scenes deal making he said: “They are like a pack of nuns who’ve convinced themselves that sex is dirty and ugly and low down and forced because they can never have it. And because they can never have it they view it all as rape instead of seduction.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotes recounting his relentless drive for the acquisition of power abound and they date from his earliest years: While a student at San Marcos College, he realized that all the funding for student activities was controlled by a group called the Black Stars who rejected him as a member. So he set about creating an entirely new campus organization called the White Stars and by his senior year, he had succeeded in wresting control of student activities from his rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And much is made of the ‘Johnson treatment’, his relentless way of literally physically trapping legislators by buttonholing them or cornering them in the Senate cloakroom and then cajoling, manipulating or brutally strong arming them into doing what he wanted. But he also used more subtle means to achieve his ends. For instance, the extending of small favors and courtesies was also a favored technique:  He would often carry a 75 cent cigar in his pocket because he knew Senator Carl Hayden loved good cigars. Or when he heard that Senator Harry Byrd’s daughter had died suddenly, he drove down to Virginia from Washington for the funeral. He was the only other Senator there. This endeared him to Byrd for years afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Process of Adapting History into Drama</title>
 <link>https://kennedyprize.columbia.edu/winners/2013/schenkkan/page/process-adapting-history-drama</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-teaser field-type-text-long field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Tom Bryant, Dramaturg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origins of &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt; lie in the creation of the American Revolutions Project at Oregon Shakespeare festival. The mandate from artistic director Bill Rauch and project director Alison Carey was to create a series of plays that would have a similar function in the American cultural context as Shakespeare’s history plays’ function in English history: to illuminate the key issues in American political history in terms of the American presidency. Robert Schenkkan was commissioned to write a play for the series and he chose Lyndon Johnson as his subject of study. I had previously worked with Robert on many plays over the years including &lt;i&gt;The Kentucky Cycle,&lt;/i&gt; which was also historically-based, and so Robert asked me to help him develop this play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of working on &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt;, Robert told me that he had chosen to focus on Johnson, because dramatically, Johnson offered incredible possibilities. Johnson was bold, larger-than-life, both incredibly skilled and sophisticated but often extremely vulgar and heavy-handed in use of power to achieve his ends. He also had deep empathy for the poor and disadvantaged. The many sides of this complex man offered a dimensionality of character that normally would be hard for a dramatist to invent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Johnson’s character provided great attendant possibilities for dialogue. In addition to anecdotal accounts, the tapes of his actual White House conversations were rich with Johnson’s witticisms and colorful speech. On one tape, he is heard flirting with Katherine Graham the publisher of the Washington Post saying: “I hear that sweet voice of yours and I’d like to break out of here and be like one of the young animals on my ranch –jump a fence!” In contrast, some of Johnson’s speeches feature some of the most stirring oratory in U.S. history. In his speech on the introduction of the Voting Rights Bill in 1965: “There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem. And we are met here tonight – not as Democrats, not as Republicans – we are met here as Americans to solve that problem.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the main appeal was the incredible story of Johnson’s orchestration of the most important advances in civil rights since the Lincoln administration. The story also had great resonance to our current era; Robert felt that the seeds of the current conservative resurgence started during the Johnson Administration in the backlash surrounding the civil rights legislation, as southern democrats left the party, and the cost of Vietnam War inflation and Great Society social programs led to burgeoning fiscal conservative opposition.  Illuminating both this high water mark in American progressivism and the conservative backlash was part of Robert’s goal in writing &lt;i&gt;All the Way&lt;/i&gt;. But in a more universal sense, Robert wanted to deal with the theme of power and the irony of its means and ends that finds such perfect expression in Shakespeare’s history cycles. Johnson was an ideal figure to use to explore this theme; he was simultaneously one of the most ruthless and clever political operatives in American politics, and at the same time he used that acumen and skill to pass some of the most idealistic, humanistic and progressive legislation in American history. This was tremendous material for a dramatist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally in my discussions with Robert, we were not sure what period of the Johnson administration to focus on: After all, Johnson was in office for 5 years from late 1963 through 1968 and a full rendering of the events of those years seemed beyond the scope of a three-hour play. Eventually Robert decided to focus on Johnson’s first year in office, 1964: Johnson came into office in that, the last year of the Kennedy presidency, and he ran for president merely a year later, which presented a natural set of boundaries. 1964 also contained landmark events with some incredible dramatic possibilities: most prominently, the passage of the 1964 civil rights bill; Mississippi Freedom Summer, the campaign for voting rights in Mississippi during the summer of 1964 during which three civil rights workers were murdered; the passage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution which heralded America’s first major escalation into the Vietnam War; and finally the election of Johnson for President in the fall of 1964.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Starting with chronologies of the legislative and cultural power struggles, we began to sift through the events looking for the most likely candidates for scene dramatization. This type of research involves looking at history from the very particular point of view of what is useful for dramatization, which benefits from anecdotes which illuminate the conflicts in history in an entertaining, shocking or insightful way or incidents that involve intense conflict, as well as memorable bits of verbal banter or quotable discourse. One might describe this research process more as panning for dramatic nuggets rather than purely factual inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; History sometimes cooperates with this dramatic agenda. In looking at the process of Johnson’s investigation of the deaths of the three civil rights workers, we learned that the discovery of the bodies of the civil rights workers on August 4, 1964 was just two days after the events in Gulf of Tonkin precipitated U.S. first major escalation into war in Vietnam and this was merely two weeks before the Democratic Convention. Both those events represented major issues for Johnson to deal with just before the convention. This type of compression of events was an incredible dramatic plus for showing Johnson in a state of crisis just before a key political event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But sometimes history presents impediments to the dramatic process. For instance, one of the most difficult issues in the process of historical adaptation is the choice of characters in the portrayal of historical events. The reality of history is that there is a plethora of characters involved in events and issues but in terms of the dramatic adaptation of history, one must boil down the number of persons or the audience will be confused as to whom to follow. For example, in terms of the conflict over the civil rights bill, Hubert Humphrey and Richard Russell stood out as particularly apt choices to represent the pro civil rights and anti-civil rights positions. Richard Russell was the unofficial leader of the segregationist southern caucus but had also been LBJ’s mentor in the Senate and his dearest friend. Thus Russell as his opposition provided complexity and rich dramatic possibilities. Humphrey had unassailable liberal credentials, and early on in his Senate years LBJ had forged an alliance with Humphrey in order to secure liberal support. LBJ had always been suspect in northern liberal circles because of his southern background. But Humphrey was vastly different than from Johnson both in temperament and style. Additionally, Humphrey’s desire to be, and eventual selection as, Vice President made for a high stake personal issue between the two men. Ultimately the history of passing the 1964 Civil Rights Bill involves many people, activists, senators and congressmen, but it seemed best to focus on a few key players like Russell and Humphrey as representative of the struggle as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History also presents plot issues: In history, although there are causal connections to events, the connections are not as tidy and one would like for dramatic purposes. There are also multiplicities of events that make focus in a linear time progression difficult. For instance, the murder of the three civil rights workers took place in early June of 1964. But the Civil Rights Bill was not passed until July 2,1964. If we were to follow exact chronological order, it would have involved attempting to wrap up the story of the passage of the bill just as the murders took place, presenting a major dramatic challenge. Ultimately we decided to tinker with the timeline of history a bit: to show the passage of the bill and then show the events of the murder afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up a fundamental question in historical adaptation: to what degree is it desirable or permissible to alter facts in history? If Shakespeare is any example, the answer is: to any degree you want! By all accounts Richard III was not a particularly bad king but according to Shakespeare, he was. For Robert and me, the clear, bright line was that the chronology was not, per se, a huge issue in this particular case. It did not meaningfully alter the basic facts of those events, or distort the sense of Johnson’s struggle and achievements during the period of time in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development is not just a research and writing process. It is impossible to emphasize enough the importance of readings and workshops in the process of play development and the role of the director and actors in this process. We were extremely fortunate in having Bill Rauch’s guidance at Oregon Shakespeare Festival and in having a permanent company of actors on hand for the workshop process, who in many cases would be playing the roles in the production itself. All told, during a four and one-half year process, beginning in 2007 there were seven readings and/or workshops, including readings at OSF and new play development festivals such at the New Harmony Project in Indiana and the Orchard Project in New York; the play was vastly reworked as a result of this process to achieve its final form.&lt;/p&gt;
